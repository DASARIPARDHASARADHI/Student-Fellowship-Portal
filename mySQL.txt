Related to database and sever issues
Store the data folder in the mysql folder in some place, so that using the "particular folder" and "ibdata1" file in that data folder we can restore a particular database
If we got any error follow a video in the youtube (hint: data_old)
Another suggestion is, do change or remove password in config.php file in the phpmyAdmin
